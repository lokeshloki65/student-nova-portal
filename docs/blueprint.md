# **App Name**: Student Central Hub

## Core Features:

- Role-Based Login: Users can select their role (Student or Admin) on the login page to access role-specific features and dashboards.
- Student Attendance View: Students can view their attendance status, including a monthly calendar view with highlighted holidays and leaves, as well as percentage calculation.
- Student Marks View: Students can access their internal marks for each subject, including a breakdown of Internal 1, Internal 2, etc., along with total marks and grades.
- Attendance Management: Admins can mark student attendance period by period on a daily basis and bulk marking.
- Marks Management: Admins can add or update internal marks for each student, with changes reflected immediately in the student's account.
- AI-Powered Announcement Prioritization: The application automatically detects which announcements or other types of info are most relevant to which users, filtering irrelevant info out, or surfacing highly relevant info to the top. The tool decides which messages apply to which students or classes. The admin provides information to the app and relies on the LLM tool to decide who should see it, and whether it is important or not.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: '#3498db' (a bright sky blue, close to your specification) to create a positive learning environment.
- Background color: '#ecf0f1' (light grey, 20% saturation) to provide a clean and calm backdrop for the content.
- Accent color: '#2ecc71' (a vibrant green) to highlight key actions and information, such as important updates or grades.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for its modern and neutral appearance. Use 'Inter' for both headings and body text for a clean, consistent look. It is suitable for information-rich apps like this one, due to its neutrality.
- Use clean and simple icons to represent different sections and actions within the app (e.g., attendance, marks, announcements) -- consistent with the light UI style.
- Utilize a card-based layout with clear spacing to organize and display information in an easily digestible manner.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations to provide a smooth user experience when navigating between different sections and views. No animations, however, are necessary in the views where a lot of data is displayed.
